* When you go over the menu sections, you should see a pointer, the background of the section should be white, and the text should be in the background color.
* When clicked, the color should change to the color of the 4th menu.
* When you go to the 4th menu, the pointer should not be visible, just an arrow should be visible and there should be no change in color.
* All information about the book should be pressed to the right.
* Previously set imaginary borders must be removed.
* Long text should be placed in the content section and scrolling should be allowed. Just scroll on the Y axis should appear.
